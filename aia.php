<td>The website seeks to target mainly large corporations to offer Yoga breaks/session for corporate workers on a regular basis for teams, but also as part of design sprints.
    <br>
Accessibility: because the Yoga the client is offering needs to be accessible to a variety of bodies/ individuals , the site also needs to be accessible to everyone.    
<br>
    The corporate managers need to quickly identify the type of classes she is offering and what her approach to Yoga is: how is the corporate business profiting from having Yoga classes?</td>
<td>Individuals, rather than teams, might be interested in a lunch Yoga session and thus need to quickly navigate how such a service might take place
Is this type of Yoga accessible to me?
</td>
    <td>Which retreats are offered?  What are the prices?  What is the location? What kind of Yoga ? Is the teacher qualified? 
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Approach</strong> </td>
<td>The client wants a website in the form of the website legalzoom.com: this means the homepage has three containers placed next to one another allowing each customer/ each customer group to directly select the specific offerings. 
    <br>
1. Corporations/ Large Businesses that want Yoga classes for teams. 
    <br>
2.Individuals who want individual Yoga classes in their lunch hours.
    <br>
3. Individuals interested in retreats. 
    <br>
    
As for the corporate managers, the site will need to expalain how Yoga makes a Business more successful. One issue to address is accessibility: how can Yoga be made accessible to everyone? 
    <br>
    
In addition, the website will also lay out the clientâ€™s Yoga training ( About me) and how she is qualified for this. There is a contact form </td>
<td> The page for individual corporate workers explains how indivduals can book an appointment and why Yoga in your lunch break/ after work is beneficial. 
    <br>
Rates. Contact Page. Approach to Yoga and Accessibility.    </td>
<td>The page for individuals interested in retreats/ private classes explains Retreats ( Schedule). Rates. Contact Page. Approach to Yoga and Accessibility.</td>
