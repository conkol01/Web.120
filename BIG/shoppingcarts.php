As to how to create an html gallery there are many options that need to be evaluated in light of the demands of the client. 
What is the purpose of sliders? Sliders provide targeted visual material that keeps the audience hooked. The images should present some added content that is not deliverable in the same way through text. Pictures can give a sensual feel for the product or the design. A slider lets you put the best artwork on showcase. Whether it’s a particular product or an entire pack of services, with different images, you can leave a powerful impact at once. Furthermore, a slider can even enhance the overall look of your website. In the age of instagram, where some companies advertise their products/ ideas merely through images, image enhanced websites are a must. 
What are the options available? 
Among the options available for image sliders, again, one has to assess the desired outcome.</p>
    
    


<p>  Among the more basic options is Elastislide, which  is a responsive jQuery carousel image viewer.  The rotating image carousel will adjust itself automatically to present itself attractively no matter what size of screen or screen resolution the viewer has.  The images will also resize themselves along with the width of the container that the carousel is in to ensure that the all of each image is viewable across various screen sizes and resolutions.
As for responsiveness, there are also sliders that incorporate the demands of responsive websites, such as Unoslider. Unoslider is a responsive image gallery that allows you to incorporate HTML rich captions and allows you to have per-slide options.  The gallery is touch enabled and mobile optimized, making it a dream for people who are viewing your images from a mobile device.  There are over 40 transitions to choose from and 12 pre built themes to use, which are easily customizable with CSS.
