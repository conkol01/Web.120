<p>
Shopping cart software is a software service that allows merchants to sell products online. Customers will then to able to browse your website, select the products they like, and complete checkout without ever leaving your domain.

<p>  As I have never built a shopping cart and do not have experience in building one, it would have really helped if the instructor had given us a short overview on her experience, and shared with us what she considers to be best practice. In the absence of this, I can only paste a few links to software I found online, with no estimation which works best. Again, I am asking myself why this class is an official class if actually no instruction is provided.
